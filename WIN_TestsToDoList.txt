Things to know about Test Plans:

	Only wines used are from Washington
	For each test case, assume they haven't done a previous test case yet
	Labels represented within single quotation marks (' ')
	Inputs represented within double quotations marks (" ")
	May want to click List mode to see wines better


Things to fix:

	Adding no named location works (not for edit location)
	Editing a location name to a name that already exists works.
	Remove location id
	Remove ??? from descriptions
	Add more default images for locations?
	'Recommend More' - stuck on loading if shelf is deleted

Other stuff:

	Make another new account and populate the same entries, then do the test cases
	Rename channels to shelves in documentations
	Add Logout, Edit Account, Register an Account, Edit Shelf (Channel) as Use Cases?
	Make sure our documentations are consistent
