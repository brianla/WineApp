Steps for Converting a String of Tags (via Add/Edit Wine Interface) to a Vector of Taste/Aroma Floats

~Properties:
	~Each Vector has 16 floats:
		~4 Taste Attributes
		~12 Aroma Attributes
	~A NxK Tag Conversion Matrix is used for Initial Value Populations
		~Where N ~= 400 and K ~= 20
	~A Tag Vector is a single row in the Tag Convesion Matrix

~Steps:
	1. Load Tag Conversion Matrix into System Memory (this is a pre-step performed once)
	2. For a given Wine and its given Tags:
		1. Process the string of Tags into a List of Tags (Strings)
		2. Foreach Tag in the Tag List, get the corresponding Tag Vector
		3. Store all Tag Vectors retrieved in this manner in a List
	3. For all Tag Vectors in the Tag Vector List:
		1. Place the Vector into one of two groups Defining and Non-Defining
			~Tag Vectors that are Defining have a non-nul value (an x) in the "Defining" column header
		2. For each Defining Tag Vector that has an Effect, place that Effect in a List of Effects
	4. Create an Average Vector for the List of Defining Tag Vectors:
		1. For each Aroma Attribute:
			1. Iterate over the List of Tag Vecvtors:
				1. If the value for the given Attribute and given Tag Vector are NOT _NaN_
				2. Add the value to a sum, and increment a counter
				3. Else, modify no values and continue to the next Tag Vector
			2. Set, in the Result Vector, the value for the given Attribute with sum/counter
	5. Create a Decayed-Sum Vector for the List of Non-Defining Tag Vectors:
		1. For each Aroma Attribute:
			1. Iterate over the List of Tag Vectors:
				1. If the value for the given Attribute and given Tag Vector are NOT _NaN_
                                2. Add the value to a sum, and increment a counter
                                3. Else, modify no values and continue to the next Tag Vector
                        2. Set, in the Result Vector, the value for the given Attribute with:
				~IF counter is not Zero, count^(DECAY_LAMBDA) * sum, ELSE, _NaN_
	6. Create a Merged Vector for the Defining Average Vector and the Non-Defining Decayed Sum Vector:
		1.For each Aroma Attribute:
			1. If both vectors (DAV and NDDSV) have non-_NaN_ values, use average of the two values
			2. If only one value in non-_NaN_ use the value as it is
			3. If both are _NaN_ use Zero
	7. Filter the Merged Vector using the List of Filters:
		1. For each Filer, perform the given operation on the Merged Vector:
			~For details of each Filter, see the Java Implementation.
	8. Normalize the Filtered Merged Vector
		1. Retrieve the Reference Vector
		2. Divide each attribute in the Filteres Merged Vector by the corresponding value in the Reference Vector
		3. For all 4 Taste Attributes, boost there values by 120% (value * 1.2)
