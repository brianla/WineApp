Recommendation Page

Add to inventory from recommendation modal looks bad (dropdown list is super huge)
Wine info modal isn't yet updated
Create shelf styling went blehg all over itself
Delete shelf and edit shelf functionality does not have button(s) and is not yet implemented
All wine pictures are the same
Opening add wine info modal then add to inventory modal then closing the add to inventory modal makes it so I can't exit out of the wine info modal
Page doesn't look very good upon loading


Profile

Needs better layout
needs better styling


------------Nitpicky section-----------


1. index has footer bar that no other part of the site has
2. "Your personal wine sommelier" is a bit hard to read
3. Register an account and log out don't do anything on hover to indicate that they're links
4. In the create account modal the filler text for locations indicates that you can have a comma, but you can't
5. Choose file and no file chosed aren't centered with "Profile image"
6. Delete location modal - change to not include number ,don't capitalize location
7. Add button on list of inventory page still needs to be changed
8. Welcome message displays again on page reload after deleting a wine.
9. Close wine info modal in 3d closes the whole modal
10. Search bar could stand to be a little bigger
