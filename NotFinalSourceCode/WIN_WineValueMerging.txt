~Wine Objects:
	~Modify the Wine (global) object to have K new non-required attributes, which are those from the Location Inventory

~Operations:
	~When building an Inventory for a given UseR:
		1. Grab all LocationInventory and Wine objects for that User
		2. For each Wine object, overwrite any attribute in common with the LocationInventory object that shares the same wineID
		3. Pass the new, modified Wine list to the Template Engine

~Reasoning:
	~The Wine objects lack User-specific data, and the User LocationInventory objects are missing Wine-specific data.
